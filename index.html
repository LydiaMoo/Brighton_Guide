              <button class="accordion">1) London Road Viaduct</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p class="details">Considered one of the best monuments of early railway architecture. 400 yards long with 26 arches, the viaduct was built in the 1940's to connect Brighton with the East Coast and is still in use today. Architect: John Urpeth Rastrick.</p>
              </div>

            <button class="accordion">2) Duke of York's Picturehouse</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p class="details">Duke of York's is the oldest cinema in continued use in Britain. Built in Edwardian Baroque style in 1910, the building has remained largely unchanged despite passing hands several times. Spot the black & white legs on the roof - one of the few newer additions. Original architect: Clayton & Black.</p>
            </div>
          </figure>



          <figure class="place">

            <button class="accordion">3) St Bartholomew's Church</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p class="details">Commissioned by Reverend Arthur Wagner in 1872. This neo-gothic church had a controversial welcome - it's an imposing building with a nave 1 metre higher than Westminster Abbey and an unusually geometric shape. Worth viewing from both outside and in. Architect: Edmund Scott, updated by Henry Wilson (1910).</p>
            </div>
          </figure>

            <button class="accordion">4) Brighton Station</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> The original terminal buildings are Italian Villa style (now converted to shops & cafes), but today's main feature is the great glass and iron canopy spanning the station. Original architect: David Mocatta, glass/iron H.E. Wallis.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">5) Theobald House</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> Housing Chairman Stanley Theobald pushed for social housing in Brighton in the 50s and 60s. Towering above the North Laine, this is the tallest of the blocks. Whilst Theobald House is by no means beautiful, Brighton's current housing crisis makes it an important marker of what can be achieved when attention is given to affordable housing. </p>

            <button class="accordion">6) Hanover Residences</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> A hilly residential area of Brighton known for its colourful Victorian houses. Also features plenty of pubs and some great panoramic views of Brighton. </p>
            </div>
          </figure>




          <figure class="place">

            <button class="accordion">7) (Abandoned) Astoria Theatre</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p class="details"> Built in art deco style featuring a vast cast iron facade. Unlike Duke of York's, this cinema couldn't survive the decline in the 70s and after a spell as a bingo hall was left derilect. The Kissing Coppers Banksy mural is not the original, but appeared shortly after the legalisation of gay marriage in the UK. Architect: Edward Albert Stone. </p>
            </div>

          <figure class="place">

            <button class="accordion">8) King & Queen's Pub</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p class="details"> In the 1930s famous local architect's Clayton & Black redesigned this pub in Tudor style; complete with tapestries, heraldic glass and carved oak timbers. In its early days it ran an illict trade with the neighbouring army barracks through a secret rear hatch still visible today. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn sit above the entrance. </p>

            <button class="accordion">9) The Royal Pavilion</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p class="details"> Probably Brighton's most well known building. Designed in the early 19th century by Henry Holland as a holiday retreat for the Prince Regent, then later developed by John Nash into the grand palace we see today. Described by Adèle d'Osmond as a "mad house", the Pavilion is packed with elaborate 'Oriental' features from the colonial era. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">10) 163 North Street</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p class="details"> Considered by many to be the chef-d'œuvre of famous local firm Clayton & Black's, 163 North Street is positioned in the heart of Brighton's bustling commercial area. Built in Edwardian Baroque style in 1904, with pink granite and a green slated roof. </p>
            </div>

              <button class="accordion">11) Embassy Court</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> A 12 story residential block built from reinforced concrete, Embassy Court is one of the only examples of the Early Modern Movement in Sussex. An interesting contrast to the usual Regency and Victorian houses on the seafront. Architect: Wells Coates, 1936. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>




            <figure class="place">

              <button class="accordion">12) Hove Bandstand</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> Designed by Phillip Lockwood in 1884, considered one of the finest standing examples of a Victorian Bandstand. It was restored in 2009. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>



            <figure class="place">

              <button class="accordion">13) Western Terrace</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> An interesting cul-de-sac off Western Road. Includes Gothic House (whilst the ground floor has been converted, the upper half remains Gothick style) and Western Pavillion, a house which was occupied by the architect Amon Henry Wilds himself and features a minature dome similar to the Royal Pavilion. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>



            <figure class="place">
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0102.jpg"/>
              <button class="accordion">14) Metropole Hotel</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> Originally designed by Alfred Waterhouse, famous for the Natural History Museum and Manchester Town Hall among others. Victorian like many other seafront buildings, but an unusual red terracotta instead of the typical whitewash. Enlarged in 1961 which unfortuntely required the removal of some of Waterhouse's features from the roofline.</p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion">15) The Grand Hotel</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> An iconic Victorian seafront hotel. In 1984 it was badly damaged by an IRA bomb intended to assassinate Margaret Thatcher, but was saved by millions of pounds of funding. Unfortunately the façade is currently undergoing a big restoration, scheduled for completion some time in 2018. Designed in 1864 by J. H. Whichcord. </p>

              <button class="accordion">16) The Brighton Centre</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> Designed in 1977 by Russell Diplock & Associates. This brutalist concrete building contrasts greatly with the ornately Victorian Grand Hotel next door. It's the biggest building of its kind in Southern England, and is regularly used for major political conferences amongst other events. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>

              <button class="accordion">17) Kingswest Building (Odeon/Pryzm)</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details">The Kingswest is a regular contender for ugliest building in Brighton, sometimes vying with the conference centre next door. Gold and metal crowning spikes are the key feature, hanging over an wide expanse of beige. Another imposing addition to the seafront. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>



            <figure class="place">

              <button class="accordion">18) (Abandoned) Brighton Hippodrome</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> Designed by Frank Matcham and opened as a variety theatre in 1902. The building is stuccoed, and the central entrance flanked by square Italianate towers with pyramid roofs.  It hosted the likes of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Charlie Chaplin, but suffered a similar fate to the Astoria; for a time converted to a Bingo Hall, but abandoned from 2007. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>



            <figure class="place">
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0198.jpg"/>
              <button class="accordion">19) Middle Street Synagogue</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> A blend of Italian Renaissance and Neo-Byzantine style, this synagogue was desined by Thomas Lainson in 1875. With an unusual yellow brick face, cotrasing blue and red tiled arches and a richly decorated interior, it's considered one of the UK's most beautiful synagogues. </p>
              </div>
            </figure>

              <button class="accordion">20) The Palace Pier</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p class="details"> A 1,722ft long Victorian pier, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. It opened in 1891, one of three Brighton piers at the time. The Royal Suspension Chain Pier was destroyed in a storm in 1896. West Pier was destroyed by a fire in 2003 and the ruins can still be seen disintegrating just west of Palace Pier today.</p>

              <div class="panel">
                <p> A stretch of cast-iron seafront arches in Brighton's distinctive turquoise. Over recent years they've fallen into disrepair, but a successful crowdfunding campaign has led to promising plans of restoration. </p>
