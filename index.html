                      <h3 class="place_name">London Road Viaduct</h3>
                      <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0310.jpg"/>
                      <p> Considered one of the best monuments of early railway architecture. 400 yards long with 26 arches, the viaduct was built in the 1940's to connect Brighton with the East Coast and is still in use today. Architect: John Urpeth Rastrick.</p>

                  <content class="place">
                    <h3>Duke of York's Picturehouse</h3>
                    <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0308.jpg"/>
                    <p> Duke of York's is the oldest cinema in continued use in Britain. Built in Edwardian Baroque style in 1910, the building has remained largely unchanged despite passing hands several times. Spot the black & white legs on the roof - one of the few newer additions. Original architect: Clayton & Black.</p>

                <content class="place">
                  <h3>St Bartholomew's Church</h3>
                  <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0277.jpg"/>
                  <p> Commissioned by Reverend Arthur Wagner in 1872. This neo-gothic church had a controversial welcome - it's an imposing building with a nave 1 metre higher than Westminster Abbey and an unusually geometric shape. Worth viewing from both outside and in. Architect: Edmund Scott, updated by Henry Wilson (1910).</p>
                </content>



              <content class="place">
                <h3>Brighton Station</h3>
                <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0270.jpg"/>
                <p> The original terminal buildings are Italian Villa style (now converted to shops & cafes), but today's main feature is the great glass and iron canopy spanning the station. Original architect: David Mocatta, glass/iron H.E. Wallis.</p>

            <content class="place">
              <h3>Theobald House</h3>

          <content class="place">
            <h3>Hanover Residences</h3>
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0041.jpg"/>
            <p> A hilly residential area of Brighton known for its colourful Victorian houses. Also features plenty of pubs and some great panoramic views of Brighton. </p>
          </content>




          <content class="place">
            <h3>(Abandoned) Astoria Theatre</h3>
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0248.jpg"/>
            <p> Built in art deco style featuring a vast cast iron facade. Unlike Duke of York's, this cinema couldn't survive the decline in the 70s and after a spell as a bingo hall was left derilect. The Kissing Coppers Banksy mural is not the original, but appeared shortly after the legalisation of gay marriage in the UK. Architect: Edward Albert Stone. </p>

          <content class="place">
            <h3>King & Queen's Pub</h3>
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0228.jpg"/>
            <p> In the 1930s famous local architect's Clayton & Black redesigned this pub in Tudor style; complete with tapestries, heraldic glass and carved oak timbers. In its early days it ran an illict trade with the neighbouring army barracks through a secret rear hatch still visible today. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn sit above the entrance. </p>

            <h3>The Royal Pavilion</h3>
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0223.jpg"/>
            <p> Brighton's most well known building. Designed in the early 19th century by Henry Holland as a holiday retreat for the Prince Regent, then later developed by John Nash into the grand palace we see today. Described by Adèle d'Osmond as a "mad house", the Pavilion is packed with elaborate 'Oriental' features from the colonial era. </p>

          <content class="place">
            <h3>163 North Street</h3>
            <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0209.jpg"/>
            <p> Considered by many to be the chef-d'œuvre of local firm Clayton & Black's. Built in Edwardian Baroque style in 1904, with pink granite and a green slated roof. </p>
          </content>


          <content class="place">
              <h3>Embassy Court</h3>
              <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0121.jpg"/>
              <p> A 12 story residential block built from reinforced concrete, Embassy Court is one of the only examples of the Early Modern Movement in Sussex. An interesting contrast to the usual Regency and Victorian houses on the seafront. Architect: Wells Coates, 1936. </p>
            </content>




            <content class="place">
              <h3>Hove Bandstand</h3>
              <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0111.jpg"/>
              <p> Designed by Phillip Lockwood in 1884, considered one of the finest standing examples of a Victorian Bandstand. It was restored in 2009. </p>
            </content>



            <content class="place">
              <h3>Western Terrace</h3>
              <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0158.jpg"/>
              <p> An interesting cul-de-sac off Western Road. Includes Gothic House (whilst the ground floor has been converted, the upper half remains Gothick style) and Western Pavillion, a house which was occupied by the architect Amon Henry Wilds himself and features a minature dome similar to the Royal Pavilion. </p>
            </content>



            <content class="place">
              <h3>Metropole Hotel</h3>
              <img src="http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc479/natashahoare/brighton%20buildings/DSC_0102.jpg"/>
              <p> Originally designed by Alfred Waterhouse, famous for designing the Natural History Museum and Manchester Town Hall among others. Victorian like many other seafront buildings, but an unusual red terracotta instead of the typical whitewash. Enlarged in 1961 which required the removal of some of Waterhouse's features from the roofline.</p>
