  <h2>About</h2>

  <br><br>

  <p>Buildings of Brighton is an interactive guide to some of Brighton's finest buildings and sites of architectural interest.
    It is by no means an exhaustive list, but contains a mixture of famous sites and some lesser-known buildings with features
    of intrigue. If you're ready for a walk, the whole list can be completed in a day! </p>

    <br>

  <p2>The website was created by Lydia, a student of architecture currently working for Brighton & Hove Council, and Tash, a soon-to-be
    graduate of anthropology at the University of Sussex. We noticed that despite Brighton's popularity as a tourist destination, there was a
    lack of any free and up-to-date resources regarding the great variety of buildings you can find here. We created the site as a project for
    Code First: Girls, an NPO running coding courses for females to help tackle the issue of gender diversity in technology. Please see
    our 'About' page if you have any feedback for us, or use the social media buttons below :) </p2>
